```
**Status:** [ ] Complete

### Step 5: Verify Deployment
```powershell
# Check all pods are running
oc get pods

# Check services
oc get services

# Check routes (external access)
oc get routes

# View logs if needed
oc logs -f deployment/data-visualization
```
**Status:** [ ] Complete

## Post-Deployment Verification üîç

### Service Health Checks
- [ ] Data-ingest pod running and healthy
- [ ] Data-clean pod running and healthy
- [ ] Data-visualization pod running and healthy
- [ ] Redis pod running and healthy

### Connectivity Tests
- [ ] Data-ingest can connect to Allas
- [ ] Data-clean receives data from ingest
- [ ] Data-visualization displays processed data
- [ ] External route accessible

### Data Flow Verification
- [ ] Files downloaded from Allas
- [ ] Data processing completed
- [ ] Visualization frontend shows results
- [ ] Redis coordination working

## Troubleshooting Guide üîß

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### 1. Pod Not Starting
```powershell
# Check pod status
oc describe pod <pod-name>

# Check logs
oc logs <pod-name>

# Common fixes:
# - Update resource limits in deployments
# - Check secret mounting
# - Verify image pull secrets
```

#### 2. Credential Issues
```powershell
# Test credentials
.\manage-allas-credentials.ps1
# Choose option 6 (Test connection)

# Update credentials if needed
# Choose option 2 (Update credentials)
```

#### 3. Route Not Accessible
```powershell
# Check route status
oc get routes

# Check service endpoints
oc get endpoints

# Verify service selector matches pod labels
oc describe service data-visualization
```

#### 4. Data Not Processing
```powershell
# Check data-ingest logs
oc logs -f deployment/data-ingest

# Check Redis connectivity
oc exec -it deployment/redis -- redis-cli ping

# Verify container/bucket exists in Allas
```

### Resource Scaling
If you need more resources:
```powershell
# Scale deployments
oc scale deployment data-clean --replicas=2

# Update resource requests/limits
oc edit deployment data-ingest
```

## Monitoring and Maintenance üìä

### Regular Checks
- [ ] Monitor resource usage in Rahti console
- [ ] Check application logs weekly
- [ ] Verify data processing results
- [ ] Update credentials as needed

### Updates and Rollbacks
```powershell
# Deploy new version
.\build-and-push.ps1
oc rollout restart deployment/data-ingest

# Rollback if needed
oc rollout undo deployment/data-ingest

# Check rollout status
oc rollout status deployment/data-ingest
```

### Backup Strategy
- [ ] Export Kubernetes configurations
- [ ] Backup processed data if needed
- [ ] Document custom configurations

## Security Best Practices üîí

### Credentials Management
- [ ] Use application credentials (not main password)
- [ ] Regularly rotate credentials
- [ ] Monitor access logs in CSC portal
- [ ] Use separate credentials per environment

### Network Security
- [ ] Review route security settings
- [ ] Consider OAuth integration
- [ ] Monitor external access logs
- [ ] Update base images regularly

### Resource Protection
- [ ] Set appropriate resource limits
- [ ] Configure pod security policies
- [ ] Review RBAC permissions
- [ ] Enable audit logging

## Performance Optimization üöÄ

### Resource Tuning
- [ ] Monitor CPU and memory usage
- [ ] Adjust resource requests/limits
- [ ] Scale replicas based on load
- [ ] Optimize container images

### Data Pipeline Efficiency
- [ ] Monitor processing times
- [ ] Optimize data transfer sizes
- [ ] Consider caching strategies
- [ ] Profile application performance
